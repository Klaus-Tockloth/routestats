## Route statistics

'routestats' determines statistical data for a route which is available in the form of a CSV file.

### Where does the CSV file come from?

The CSV file can be created via the following (OpenStreetMap based) web services:

* https://brouter.m11n.de/
* https://bikerouter.de/

### How to create the CSV file?

* Variant 1: Manual creation of a route.
* Variant 2: Conversion of an existing track into a route.
  * Use the pseudo routing profile 'Dummy' for this.
  * Use as many track points as possible (justify function).
    * This ensures that the calculated route is very close to the given track.
* Export the route as a CSV file.
